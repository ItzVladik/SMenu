# Issues  
1. The models in this panel do not display normally. Only large models are displayed, as shown in the screenshot.
2. The icons I converted are shifting a bit for some reason, with other icons drawn normally. Maybe I converted the images crookedly.

# TODO  
1. Make a render of the model in VTF texture and make the menu with props as menu with entity
